## Focusing on variables

Now that we know how to *glimpse* into our data, let's work on *select*ing specific variables of interest.

Let's say the *Galactic News Hub* has asked you to write a story about height differences across different species. What function would you use to *select* only the following variables in `starwars`: `name`, `height`, `homeworld`, and `species`? (Make sure you list your variables in that order!)

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| label: selecting
starwars |> 
  ______(____, ______, _________, _______)
```


::: {.solution exercise="ex_2"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| solution: true
starwars |> 
  select(name, height, homeworld, species)
```

:::
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| check: true
grade_this_code()
```

::: {.hint exercise="ex_2"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Hint

J-327D suggests the `select()` function, which you can [learn about here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/select.html).

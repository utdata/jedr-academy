## Arranging our Data

J-327D has seen you *glimpse* the data and *select* variables in `starwars`. He now wants to find the tallest character.

What function should you add to the code below to *arrange* the data so the tallest person is listed at the top? (**Important note:** Since `tidyverse` *arrange*s numbers from the smallest to the greatest number, you may need another function so the information is in *desc*ending order.)

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_3
starwars |> 
  select(name, height, homeworld, species) |>   
  _______(____(______))
```


::: {.solution exercise="ex_3"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_3
#| solution: true
starwars |> 
  select(name, height, homeworld, species) |>   
  arrange(desc(height))
```

:::
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_3
#| check: true
grade_this_code()
```

::: {.hint exercise="ex_3"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Hint

J-327D recommends checking out the `arrange()` function, which you can [learn about here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html). Don't forget to put your result in **desc**ending order.

## JedR challenge

### If J-327D asked you to write about the tallest being in the galaxy, who would it be?

Perhaps a towering Wookiee or a menacing Sith lord... Letâ€™s see!

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Click to reveal the answer

The tallest character is **Yarael Poof** with a height of **264 cm**.

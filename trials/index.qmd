These modules are designed to test your R skills through a series of interactive lessons. Each module introduces different journalism-centric data science techniques, using exercises based on the `starwars` dataset. The topics covered are tailored to the Reporting with Data class.


- [Introduction](/trials/jedr-trial-01-intro.html):
  Introduces the `starwars` data and the interactive format of the
  lessons. Covers some basic functions to look at data.
- [Summarize with Count](/trials/jedr-trial-02-count.html): Covers
  counting rows using group_by and summarize. (We skip `count()` here to
  focus on group_by, summarize and arrange.)
- [Summarize with Math](/trials/jedr-trial-03-sum.html):
  Covers grouping data and math functions within summarize.
- [Plotting](/trials/jedr-trial-04-plot.html): Making a
  very basic ggplot chart.
- [Pivoting](/trials/jedr-trial-05-pivot.html): Making
  data wider and longer.
- [Bind and Join](/trials/jedr-trial-06-bind.html):
  Combining data.

If you'd like to run them locally, you can find the necessary files in the `trials/` folder.

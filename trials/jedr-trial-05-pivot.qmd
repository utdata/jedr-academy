## JedR Trial No. 5: Pivot data

<div style="float:right; margin-left:20px"><img src="images/jedi-pivot.webp" width="200"></div>

In this JedR Trial we will explore your ability to pivot data to suit your needs. This is a common challenge to prepare data for charting in ggplot or [Datawrapper](https://www.datawrapper.de/).

Your droid editor (J-327D) has sent you some data that they would like to see in a different format. J-327D is pretty sure you can use your JedR powers to "pivot" this data to their liking.

<br clear="both">

## Make wider tables

This is the data you get from J-327D. It is a table with the number of `characters` (as in characters in a story) from the `starwars` data based on their `species` and `gender` identity.

```{webr}
#| edit: FALSE
characters
```

But J-327D would like to see this data formatted so that it is easier to read ... where for each species there is a column for each gender value. Like this:

```{webr}
#| edit: false
wider_pivot
```

### Do. Or do not. There is no try.

Write the code below that will transform the `characters` data into the format noted above.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
characters |> 
  ___________(__________ = ______, ___________ = _)
```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
#| check: true

if (identical(.result, characters |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = gender, values_from = n))) {
  list(correct = TRUE, message = sample(praise_list, 1))
} else {
  list(correct = FALSE, message = sample(again_list, 1))
}
```

::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}
## Hint 1

You might review the [pivoting vignette](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/articles/pivot.html) in the Tidyverse documentation.

### Repeat, you must. Train yourself!

Well done, Padawan. Your droid editor is quite pleased, but now they want to see the table with the species as the new columns.

Can you make the `characters` data look like this:

```{webr}
#| edit: false
wider_pivot_characters
```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
characters |> 
  ___________(__________ = _______, ___________ = _)
```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| check: true

if (identical(.result, characters |> 
  pivot_wider(names_from = species, values_from = n))) {
  list(correct = TRUE, message = sample(praise_list, 1))
} else {
  list(correct = FALSE, message = sample(again_list, 1))
}
```

## Make longer views

### Control, control, you must learn control!

Now that you have mastered, pivoting wider, can you go back the other way?

Starting with our first widened table, which will be in a tibble called `gender_table`, can you convert the data back to its original form, to this?

```{webr}
#| edit: FALSE
characters
```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_3
gender_table |> 
  ____________(____ = _:_, ________ = "______", _________ = "_")
```

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_3
#| check: true

if (identical(.result, gender_table |> 
  pivot_longer(cols = 2:3, names_to = "gender", values_to = "n"))) {
  list(correct = TRUE, message = sample(praise_list, 1))
} else {
  list(correct = FALSE, message = sample(again_list, 1))
}
```

Great job, padawan. Please inform your JedR Master that you have completed this trial. "Even the greatest Jedi faced many trials. Trust in the Force, and continue on your journey." [Embrace Your Path](/trials/jedr-trial-06-bind.html)

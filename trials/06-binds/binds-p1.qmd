With this JedR Trial, you will prove your experience in combining data. While we are using the `starwars` data in a fashion, it has been broken up into parts that you need to put back together.

## About our data

We start with three separate data frames for `humans`, `droids` and `other` species. The data frames have basic information on these characters, like `height`, `weight`, etc.

The `droids` data looks like this:

```{webr}
#| edit: false
#| echo: false
droids
```

The `humans` and `other` data frames are similar, but have characters from those species only.

## Stack the data

Starting with the `droids` data, stack it together with the two other data frames (`humans` and `other`) and store the result into a single data frame called `characters`. You should end up with 87 observations with 6 variables. After you create the `characters` data frame, print it out to your notebook.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
characters <- droids |> 
  _________(humans, other)

characters

```


::: {.solution exercise="ex_1"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
#| solution: true
characters <- droids |> 
  bind_rows(humans, other)

characters
```

:::
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_1
#| check: true
grade_this_code()
```

::: {.hint exercise="ex_1"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Hint 1

You might review the [bind vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/bind.html) in the Tidyverse documentation.

## Add columns with join

Now that you have created the `characters` data, we need to join this with a different data set. Our `characters` data has the name of the character along with variables for physical characteristics like height and weight, etc.

We have a different data set available to us, called `sw_bio` that has more information, like the `homeworld` and `species` of each character. It looks like this:

```{webr}
#| edit: false
#| echo: false
sw_bio
```


Your droid editor, J-327D, has asked you to **add this `sw_bio` information to your characters data**.

You should end up with the same 87 observations, but you should end up with 11 variables.

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
characters  |> 
  _________(sw_bio)
```


::: {.solution exercise="ex_2"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| solution: true
characters  |> 
  left_join(sw_bio)
```

:::
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| check: true
grade_this_code()
```

::: {.hint exercise="ex_2"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Hint

You might review the [join vignette](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/mutate-joins.html) in the Tidyverse documentation.

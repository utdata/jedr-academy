While the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions are great for summarizing this information, a [Padawan youngling](https://www.starwars.com/news/what-is-a-padawan) has pointed out that the information is not ordered. 

ðŸ™„ Rolling your eyes, you tell them that you know this! We just need to use another function in order to **arrange** this data. It's time for you to demostrate this. J-327D notes that journalists  are typically interested in the *most* of something, so to make sure to sort in **desc**ending order.

## Sorting a dataframe

**Change the counted list to show the species with the most characters are the top**

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
starwars |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarize(characters = n()) |>
  _______(____(__________))
```

::: {.solution exercise="ex_2"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Solution

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| solution: true
starwars |>
  group_by(species) |>
  summarize(characters = n()) |>
  arrange(desc(characters))
```

:::
:::

```{webr}
#| exercise: ex_2
#| check: true
grade_this_code()
```

::: {.hint exercise="ex_2"}
::: {.callout-note collapse="false"}

### Hint

J-327D wonders just how many hints you need, but suggests you check out [`arrange()`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html).

## JedR challenge

Your driod editor J-327D has traversed the galaxy but still wonders ...

### Which species dominates the galaxy?

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}

### Click to reveal the answer

There are **35 Human characters** in the `starwars` data, the most of all species.

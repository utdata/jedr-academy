## JedR Trail 2: Summarize by counting

As a **JedR Padawan** of the *Galactic News Hub*, you have been assigned to help with a new story about the demographics of the Star Wars Universe. After pitching a few different topics, your droid editor (J-327) has green lighted a pitch about species variation. For this article, you have been asked to provide a summary statistic about which species is the most common in the Star Wars universe.

For this task, you will **summarize** and **group** the characters by species. You will then **arrange** the data to identify the most common species of all the Star Wars characters. Thankfully, you learned how to do these things in Chapter 3 and 4 of [our textbook](https://utdata.github.io/rwdir/counts-import.html).

### 1. Summarizing

If you recall from our earlier exercise, `starwars` is a dataset with 87 Star Wars characters.

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(starwars)
```

First, we'll need to *group* the data by species and then *summarize* by counting the *n*umber of rows of each species (we will tackle arranging **after**, not now).

How do we do that? What functions would we use?

```{r gbsumexercise, exercise = TRUE}
starwars %>%
  
# we recommend naming the new field "characters"!
```

```{r gbsumexercise-solution}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(characters = n())
```

```{r gbsumexercise-check}
grade_this({
  if(identical(.result,.solution)){ 
    pass(sample(praise_list, 1))
  }
  fail()
})

```

<div id="gbsumexercise-hint">
**Hint:** Check out the `group_by()` and `summarize()` in [Chapter 4](https://utdata.github.io/rwdir/count-analysis.html#summarize)
</div>

### 2. Arrange

While the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions are great for summarizing this information, a [young padawan](https://www.starwars.com/news/what-is-a-padawan) has pointed out that the information is not ordered. 

ðŸ™„ Rolling your eyes, you tell them that you know this! We just need to use another function in order to **arrange** this data. To illustrate your point, let's **arrange** this data now.

As a tip, don't forget that we often want to sort the information by **desc**ending order, because journalists are typically interested in the *most* of something.

```{r arrangeexercise, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=5}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(characters = n())
```

<div id="arrangeexercise-hint">
**Hint:** Check out `arrange` in [Chapter 4](https://utdata.github.io/rwdir/count-analysis.html#arrange-the-results)
</div>

```{r arrangeexercise-solution}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(characters = n()) %>%
  arrange(characters %>% desc())
```

```{r arrangeexercise-check}
grade_this({
  if(identical(.result,.solution)){
    pass(sample(praise_list, 1))
  }
  fail()
})
```

Now that you've **grouped** the data, **summarized** the number of characters of each species, and **arranged** the data (in **desc**ending order), you can finally tell your editor that you've compiled this information!

```{r quiz-arrange, echo = FALSE}
quiz(
  question("What species is the most common in Star Wars?",
    answer("Human", correct = TRUE),
    answer("Droid"),
    answer("Aleena"),
    answer("Iktotchi")
  )
)
```

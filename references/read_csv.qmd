## Official documenation

## Common use examples

### Simple import

The first argument is the path to the file as a string.

```{r}
read_csv("data/starwars.csv")
```

```{r}
starwars <- read_csv("data/starwars.csv")
```

### Set column headers

Sometimes a files may not have column headers, or you may want to set your own.

## JedR Trial No. 2: Summarize by counting

As a **JedR Padawan** of the *Galactic News Hub*, you have been assigned to help with a new story about the demographics of the Star Wars Universe. After pitching a few different topics, your droid editor (J-327D) has green lighted a pitch about species variation. For this article, you have been asked to provide a summary statistic about which species is the most common in the Star Wars universe.

For this task, you will **summarize** and **group** the characters by species. You will then **arrange** the data to identify the most common species of all the Star Wars characters.

### 1. Summarizing

If you recall from our earlier exercise, `starwars` is a dataset with 87 Star Wars characters.

```{r glimpse}
glimpse(starwars)
```

First, we'll need to *group* the data by species and then *summarize* by counting the *n*umber of rows of each species. (We will tackle the arranging part later.)

How do we do that? What functions would we use?

```{r gbsumexercise, exercise = TRUE}
starwars %>%
  
# we insist you name the new variable "characters"!
```

```{r gbsumexercise-solution}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(characters = n())
```

```{r gbsumexercise-check}
grade_this({
  if(identical(.result,.solution)){ 
    pass(sample(praise_list, 1))
  }
  fail()
})

```

<div id="gbsumexercise-hint">
**Hint:** Check out the `group_by()` and `summarize()` in [Chapter 4](https://utdata.github.io/rwdir/count-analysis.html#summarize)
</div>

### 2. Arrange the results

While the `group_by()` and `summarize()` functions are great for summarizing this information, a [Padawan youngling](https://www.starwars.com/news/what-is-a-padawan) has pointed out that the information is not ordered. 

ðŸ™„ Rolling your eyes, you tell them that you know this! We just need to use another function in order to **arrange** this data. To illustrate your point, let's **arrange** this data now.

As a tip, don't forget that we often want to sort the information by **desc**ending order, because journalists are typically interested in the *most* of something.

```{r arrangeexercise, exercise = TRUE, exercise.lines=5}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(characters = n())
```

<div id="arrangeexercise-hint">
**Hint:** Check out `arrange`. You can [learn more here](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/arrange.html).  
</div>

```{r arrangeexercise-solution}
starwars %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(characters = n()) %>%
  arrange(characters %>% desc())
```

```{r arrangeexercise-check}
grade_this({
  if(identical(.result,.solution)){
    pass(sample(praise_list, 1))
  }
  fail()
})
```

Now that you've **grouped** the data, **summarized** the number of characters of each species, and **arranged** the data (in **desc**ending order), you can finally tell your editor that you've compiled this information!

```{r quiz-arrange, echo = FALSE}
question("What species is the most common in Star Wars?",
  answer("Human", correct = TRUE),
  answer("Droid"),
  answer("Aleena"),
  answer("Iktotchi"),
  random_answer_order = TRUE
)
```

Excellent! Please tell your JedR Master that you have completed this trial.

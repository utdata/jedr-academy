There are two main goals:\n\nTo focus tutorials on feats of skill or tasks to accomplish instead of on specific packages or functions.\nTo use the same data whenever possible to avoid the cognitive load of learning new data for each example.\n\nThere are two types of lessons:\n\nJedR Training: Tutorials focused on feats of skills instead of on specific packages. For instance, “How to manage dates” vs “How to use lubridate.”\nJedR Trials: Short tests over specific skills. These trials are used by students in our J 327D Reporting with Data class.\n\nJedR Padawans can download the repo and run each notebook on their local machines. The notebooks are stored in the training/ and trials/ folders. All notebooks require tidyverse, learnr and gradethis.

The name should be slug-friendly: all lowercase, words connected with dashes.\nDo git branch to double-check which branch are on.\n\nAt this point, you are working on YOUR copy of the code. You can experiment, add and commit code at will. You can push the code to Github in your branch with …\ngit push origin new-branch\n… but with your branch name.\nDo know if you edit existing files on your local branch that also get edited by others, then we will have to resolve any conflicts. That’s fine, but can be complicated. Just reach out to Christian for help.\n\nPull requests\nWhen you are done with your changes and want to merge them into the default branch, let Christian know via email and he’ll create a Pull Request. If you want to learn more about that, then request to do it together and he’ll explain it.\nThe pull request process compares the new code to the existing code and notes any conflicts, which have to be “resolved” before the branches can be merged."

These should be saved in the trails folder.\nA Training is a more involved tutorial designed to teach a new skill using familiar data sets, with some fun thrown in.

    "text": "How to make categories from data\nWelcome Padawan. May your quest to become a JedR Master be fruitful. “Do or do not. There is no try.”\nSometimes as journalists (or data scientists) we need to create new categories for our data. An example might be where we have a column of data that has too many different values to plot effectively. We might be able to re-categorize those values to fewer individual choices, maybe combining less important values into a generic term like “other”.\nSome real-worldish examples:\n\nYou want to show race/ethnicity breakdowns in a chart or story about Hispanic representation. There are eight different values and some are quite small. You might create a column to use the values Asian, Black, Hispanic and White with all others changed to “Other”.\nPerhaps you are doing a story on crime and want to highlight violent crimes vs property vs other crimes. You might create a new column that categorizes many individual charges into these buckets.\n\nWe’re taking records and putting them into piles or groups based on one or more values.\n\nJedR Mind Trick: When we categorize values like this, we want to create a new column intead of overwriting an existing one. This way you can check your work. You can always remove or rename columns later.\n\n\nGoals of this training session\n\nTo apply case_match() within a mutate() to create data categories. It’s a one-to-one match, for the most part.\nTo apply case_when() within a mutate() to create data categories. This allows more complex logic."

Our editor is hoping we can later cross reference these categories against gender and other variables within the source list.\nTo accomplish this, it would be helpful to have a “species_category” variable using these three values so we can group and aggregate with other columns.\nLet’s take a look at the species column using count().\n\nstarwars %&gt;% count(species, sort = TRUE, name = \"cnt\")\n\n# A tibble: 38 × 2\n   species    cnt\n   &lt;chr&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1 Human       35\n 2 Droid        6\n 3 &lt;NA&gt;         4\n 4 Gungan       3\n 5 Kaminoan     2\n 6 Mirialan     2\n 7 Twi'lek      2\n 8 Wookiee      2\n 9 Zabrak       2\n10 Aleena       1\n# ℹ 28 more rows\n\n\nYou can see that Human and Droid values dominate the data.

    "title": "JedR: Categorization",
    "section": "Using case_match()",
    "text": "Using case_match()\nOne of the easier methods to categorize data is to use case_match(). The logic is straighforward: For this value, substitute that value.\nTo make clear our goal here for the Galactic Hub News: We want to create a new column called species_category that has three values: Human, Droid, Other/Unknown. And they need to be based on the existing species variable.\n\nHow case_match works\nWhile is is possible to recatagorize our values into the same column, a good JedR will instead use mutate() and case_when() to create a new column and then filling it with the results.\ndata %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    new_column = case_when(\n      existing_column,\n      \"Old Value 1 from existing_column\" ~ \"New Value 1\",\n      \"Old Value 2 from existing_column\" ~ \"New Value 2\",\n      .default = \"Value for everything else\"\n    )\n  )\n\nThis is standard usage for the mutate() function … you create the new column and then set it to a value. In this case, we are setting the value to the result of the case_when() function.\nWithin case_when(), we have to first name the column we are pulling from. Like where are we looking for these values?\nThen we have a series of statements separated with ~. If we find what is on the left-hand side, then we change it to what is on the right side.\nLastly we have a “default” to handle everything else we haven’t specified. In some cases you night make this .default = existing_column to keep the existing value for those rows.\n\nThe order you put these is important. Once a match has been found and updated, that value won’t be changed again.\nSo, with our starwars data, a partial solution might look like this:\n\nstarwars %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    species_category = case_match(\n      species,\n      \"Gungan\" ~ \"Other/Unknown\",\n      \"Neimodian\" ~ \"Other/Unknown\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;% # using select and slice to focus on the change\n  select(name, species, species_category) %&gt;% slice(31:40)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   name          species   species_category\n   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;           \n 1 Qui-Gon Jinn  Human     &lt;NA&gt;            \n 2 Nute Gunray   Neimodian Other/Unknown   \n 3 Finis Valorum Human     &lt;NA&gt;            \n 4 Padmé Amidala Human     &lt;NA&gt;            \n 5 Jar Jar Binks Gungan    Other/Unknown   \n 6 Roos Tarpals  Gungan    Other/Unknown   \n 7 Rugor Nass    Gungan    Other/Unknown   \n 8 Ric Olié      Human     &lt;NA&gt;            \n 9 Watto         Toydarian &lt;NA&gt;            \n10 Sebulba       Dug       &lt;NA&gt;            \n\n\nIn the example above, we use slice() to skip down to part of the data where we can see the change. (The first 20 rows are all humans and droids.) We also used select() to focus on our columns of interest.\nNote we’ve only changed two of the 36 values we need to change, though.

This method is very handy if you have just a few things to change.\nIn our case here, we could list all 36 changes, but … Use the Force, Luke.\n\n\nUsing .default\ncase_match() changes exactly what you specify and leaves anything you don’t specify as NA. If you want the non-matches to be something else, you can specify them with .default =.\nUsing this, we can set Human to Human and Droid to Droid, but then everything else to Other/Unknown.\nNOTE that the specific matches use ~ to separate what to look for and what to change it to, but the .default designation uses =.\n\nstarwars %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    species_category = case_match(\n      species,\n      \"Human\" ~ \"Human\",\n      \"Droid\" ~ \"Droid\",\n      .default = \"Other/Unknown\",\n    )\n  ) %&gt;% # using select and slice to focus on change\n  select(name, species, species_category) %&gt;% slice(31:40)\n\n# A tibble: 10 × 3\n   name          species   species_category\n   &lt;chr&gt;         &lt;chr&gt;     &lt;chr&gt;           \n 1 Qui-Gon Jinn  Human     Human           \n 2 Nute Gunray   Neimodian Other/Unknown   \n 3 Finis Valorum Human     Human           \n 4 Padmé Amidala Human     Human           \n 5 Jar Jar Binks Gungan    Other/Unknown   \n 6 Roos Tarpals  Gungan    Other/Unknown   \n 7 Rugor Nass    Gungan    Other/Unknown   \n 8 Ric Olié      Human     Human           \n 9 Watto         Toydarian Other/Unknown   \n10 Sebulba       Dug       Other/Unknown   \n\n\n\n\nCheck your results\n\nJedR Mind Trick: Even with these few rows, it’s hard to see all the changes made in your data.

On the left is a logical test, and on the right is a new value designation.\nEach rule is run in order. A value is set only once, so if a value is set in one rule, it will NOT be reset by subsequent rules. You must write your rules from the most specific to the most general.\nThe last line TRUE ~ handles all values not already changed. If left out, values not specified would be set NA.\n\n\nA more complex example\nUnlike case_match() where you are drawing from values in one specific column, the logic tests used with case_when() can be just about anything as long as they evaluate to TRUE or FALSE.\nWhile this is a silly example, here we create a column called size_compare that notes if a character is “larger” or “smaller” than an average human, unless they are a droid, in which case they are labeled “mechanical”.\n\nstarwars %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    size_compare = case_when(\n      species == \"Droid\" ~ \"mechanical\",\n      height &gt;= 170 & mass &gt;= 80 ~ \"larger\",\n      TRUE ~ \"smaller\"\n    )\n  ) %&gt;% \n  select(name, size_compare)\n\n# A tibble: 87 × 2\n   name               size_compare\n   &lt;chr&gt;              &lt;chr&gt;       \n 1 Luke Skywalker     smaller     \n 2 C-3PO              mechanical  \n 3 R2-D2              mechanical  \n 4 Darth Vader        larger      \n 5 Leia Organa        smaller     \n 6 Owen Lars          larger      \n 7 Beru Whitesun Lars smaller     \n 8 R5-D4              mechanical  \n 9 Biggs Darklighter  larger      \n10 Obi-Wan Kenobi     smaller     \n# ℹ 77 more rows\n\n\nNote we started with the rule for “Droid” because that is the most specific thing we needed to change.

To illustrate your point, let’s arrange this data now.\nAs a tip, don’t forget that we often want to sort the information by descending order, because journalists are typically interested in the most of something.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nstarwars |&gt;\n  group_by(species) |&gt;\n  summarize(characters = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(characters |&gt; desc())\nstarwars |&gt;\n  group_by(species) |&gt;\n  summarize(characters = n()) |&gt;\n  arrange(characters |&gt; desc())\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nheck out arrange. You can learn more here.\n\n\n\n\nNow that you’ve grouped the data, summarized the number of characters of each species, and arranged the data (in descending order), you can finally tell your editor that you’ve compiled this information!\nWhat species is the most common in Star Wars?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\"Human\"\n\"Human\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExcellent! Please tell your JedR Master that you have completed this trial."

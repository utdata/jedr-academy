Your first task: apply beginning tidyverse skills to learn about the characters in the Star Wars universe you‚Äôll be reporting on.\n\n1. Previewing our data\nFor this exercise, we will use the data collection called starwars. This data comes with the tidyverse package. As you can see below, starwars contains some information about Star Wars characters, like their name and height.\nLet‚Äôs learn a bit more about the structure of the starwars data and how to conquer these JedR Trials.\nThis is what it looks like when we load the tidyverse library and look at the first few lines in the starwars data. Each row of the data is a character within the Star Wars franchise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the JedR Trails, you can enter and run code right inside this page. Please make sure to only remove the underscores to add your answers. Since the tidyverse was loaded above, all the functions you would normally see in RStudio are available. Once you enter the code, click the blue Run Code button to see the results.\nThe first thing you need to learn is how many rows are in the starwars data, along with all the columns and datatypes.\nWhat function would you add to the starwars data here to glimpse the data and find those answers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the glimpse() function. You can learn more here.\n\n\n\n\nJust as you submitted the answer, your humanoid robot editor (J-327D) pops into your office and asks you how many people (characters) are in your data. What is your answer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the rows from the previous question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Focusing on variables\nNow that we know how to glimpse into our data, let‚Äôs work on selecting specific variables of interest. Let‚Äôs say the Galactic News Hub has asked you to write a story about height differences across different species. What function would you use to select only the following variables in starwars: name, height, homeworld, and species? (Hint: Write your function in that order!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might look into the select() function, you can learn about here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Arranging our Data\nNow that we have glimpsed our data and selected our variables in the starwars, let‚Äôs arrange them using by height. What function would we add to our code below to arrange our data so that the tallest person is listed at the top? (Hint: since tidyverse arranges numbers from the smallest to the greatest number, you may need another function so the information is in descending order.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nI recommend checking out the arrange() function, you can learn about here. Don‚Äôt forget to put your result in descending order.\n\n\n\n\nSo many tall characters! If your humanoid robot editor (J-327D) wanted you to write a story about the tallest character in the data, who would that be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the result of previous code chunk\n\n\n\n\nGreat job!

There is no try.‚Äù\nSometimes as journalists (or data scientists) we need to create new categories for our data. An example might be where we have a column of data that has too many different values to plot effectively. We might be able to re-categorize those values to fewer individual choices, maybe combining less important values into a generic term like ‚Äúother‚Äù.\nSome real-worldish examples:\n\nYou want to show race/ethnicity breakdowns in a chart or story about Hispanic representation. There are eight different values and some are quite small. You might create a column to use the values Asian, Black, Hispanic and White with all others changed to ‚ÄúOther‚Äù.\nPerhaps you are doing a story on crime and want to highlight violent crimes vs property vs other crimes. You might create a new column that categorizes many individual charges into these buckets.\n\nWe‚Äôre taking records and putting them into piles or groups based on one or more values.\n\nJedR Mind Trick: When we categorize values like this, we want to create a new column intead of overwriting an existing one. This way you can check your work. You can always remove or rename columns later.\n\n\nGoals of this training session\n\nTo apply case_match() within a mutate() to create data categories.

    "section": "Using case_match()",
    "text": "Using case_match()\nOne of the easier methods to categorize data is to use case_match(). The logic is straighforward: For this value, substitute that value.\nTo make clear our goal here for the Galactic Hub News: We want to create a new column called species_category that has three values: Human, Droid, Other/Unknown. And they need to be based on the existing species variable.\n\nHow case_match works\nWhile is is possible to recatagorize our values into the same column, a good JedR will instead use mutate() and case_when() to create a new column and then fill it with the results.\ndata |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    new_column = case_when(\n      existing_column,\n      \"Old Value 1 from existing_column\" ~ \"New Value 1\",\n      \"Old Value 2 from existing_column\" ~ \"New Value 2\",\n      .default = \"Value for everything else\"\n    )\n  )\n\nThis is standard usage for the mutate() function ‚Ä¶ you create the new column and then set it to a value. In this case, we are setting the value to the result of the case_when() function.\nWithin case_when(), we have to first name the column we are pulling from. Like where are we looking for these values?\nThen we have a series of statements separated with ~. If we find what is on the left-hand side, then we change it to what is on the right-hand side.\nLastly we have a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù to handle everything else we haven‚Äôt specified. In some cases you might make this .default = existing_column to keep the existing value for those rows.\n\nThe order you put these is important. Once a match has been found and updated, that value won‚Äôt be changed again.\nSo, with our starwars data, a partial solution might look like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the example above, we use slice() to skip down to part of the data where we can see the change. (The first 20 rows are all humans and droids.) We also used select() to focus on our columns of interest.\nNote we‚Äôve only changed two of the values we need to change, though. (You can see Toydarian and Dug have not been changed.) This method is very handy if you have just a few things to change.\nIn our case here, we could list all 36 changes, but ‚Ä¶ Use the Force, Luke.\n\n\nUsing .default\ncase_match() changes exactly what you specify and leaves anything you don‚Äôt specify as NA. If you want the non-matches to be something else, you can specify them with .default =.\nUsing this, we can set Human to Human and Droid to Droid, but then everything else to Other/Unknown.\nNOTE that the specific matches use ~ to separate what to look for and what to change it to, but the .default designation uses =.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck your results\n\nJedR Mind Trick: Even with these few rows, it‚Äôs hard to see all the changes made in your data. It is sometimes helpful to do a count() on your changes to check them. Just be sure to count the already-changed data, not the result you are saving into the new object.\n\nHere we save the recategorized data into a new object called sw_species and then run a count() on our two columns to check the results.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe case_match() function works great if you have one-to-one changes that don‚Äôt require logic. But when you have more complex needs, we need more Force."

Do fix this, we can use lubridate‚Äôs parse date functions. In this particular dataset, the dates are written in the dmy (date-month-year) format. (If you look in the glimpse() output above, you‚Äôll see that the first observation, for example, was: ‚Äú13-Oct-14‚Äù).

    "text": "Using specific parts of a date\n\nWhich month had the most episodes (throughout the entire period)?\nTo answer this question, we can use Lubridate‚Äôs month() function, which allows us to focus only on months (while ignoring years). It works like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere, we‚Äôre creating a new dataframe called rebels_cl_newcols. We‚Äôll use this to add more columns later on.\nIt‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that ‚Äúmonth‚Äù is now the name of a column (which we just created) and the name of a function from the lubridate package. That can be a bit confusing and it‚Äôs generally best to avoid creating object with the same names as functions.\nAlso, see how the newly created month column only has information about which month the episodes aired in, in this case ‚Äú10‚Äù (October) for the first three observations and ‚Äú11‚Äù (November) for the next four observations. If we wanted the names of the months, we can use the label = TRUE argument within the month function. Like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the type for month is ‚Äúord‚Äù? This means that the column is written as an ‚Äúordered factor‚Äù, which simply means (in this case) that although it looks like text, it would be ordered by time, not alphabetically. In other words, we can sort by the month column, if we want to do so:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSee how it‚Äôs arranged by month?\nGoing back to our question about which month had the most episodes, let‚Äôs take a look:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIt looks like there were lot‚Äôs of new episodes in October, November, February, and March.\nAs a quick aside, when we do the month labels, we can also get R to write out the full month rather than the abbreviation. Let‚Äôs look at an example:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe abbr argument defaults to TRUE, so if we don‚Äôt specific abbr = FALSE, we‚Äôd get the abbreviated version as we saw above.\n\nPadawan practice: using the year() function\nTo get information about specific years, we can use the year() function, which is quite similar. Try to create a variable called year see we can check how many episodes aired in each year.\nHint: you‚Äôll need to use the air_date_fixed column.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFloor_date()\nAn alternative would be to use Lubridate‚Äôs floor_date()-function, which let‚Äôs us round date-time objects down to their nearest year, month, week, day, etc. It works like this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the new column, month_floor, only include dates that are the first day in any given month?\nRounding the dates to their nearest year/month/week/day/etc can be helpful later on, for example when visualizing the data. Instead of round to the nearest values, we can use ceiling_date() to round up to the nearest value or round_date() to round to the closest value. In this tutorial we‚Äôll mostly focus on floor_date() but as a future JedR Master, you should know about the other options, too!\nOkay, let‚Äôs create a dataframe with four new columns, rounded by floor_date(). We‚Äôll use this later on.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe yday() function\nWhat if we wanted to find the earliest date within a year that an episode aired? For that purpose, we could use the yday() (year day) function, which simply tells us how many days into a year a given date is. My son and I share the same birthday (February 5). That‚Äôs the 36th day of the year:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo find the earliest episode airdate for each year, we could do this:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis shows the first-aired episode for each of the years from 2014‚Äì2018. Notice the few doppelg√§ngers? It looks like seasons 3 and 4 started each started with a double episode.\nThere are few things going on in the chunk above. Here‚Äôs a quick recap of what each line does:\n\nWe start with our object, rebels_rounded_cols, and then ‚Ä¶\nWe use mutate() to create a new column called dy ‚Ä¶\nTo get the dy column to specify each dates number within a year, we use yday(), and then ‚Ä¶\nWe group_by() because we want the earliest episode within each year, and then ‚Ä¶\nWe use slice_min() to get just the earliest episode within each year. (Otherwise, our output would all the episodes.) And then ‚Ä¶\nWe use ungroup() to remove the grouped dy column. Not essential here but might be handy if you need to perform additional operations. And then ‚Ä¶\nselect() let‚Äôs us show just a few columns to make the output more readable at a glance."

    "text": "JedR Trial No.¬†1: Introduction\nCongratulations! You have recently been hired as a data jedi for the Galactic News Hub, the premiere news organization for the Star Wars Universe. Your first task: apply beginning tidyverse skills to learn about the characters in the Star Wars universe you‚Äôll be reporting on.\n\n1. Previewing our data\nFor this exercise, we will use the data collection called starwars. This data comes with the tidyverse package. As you can see below, starwars contains some information about Star Wars characters, like their name and height.\nLet‚Äôs learn a bit more about the structure of the starwars data and how to conquer these JedR Trials.\nThis is what it looks like when we load the tidyverse library and look at the first few lines in the starwars data. Each row of the data is a character within the Star Wars franchise:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWithin the JedR Trails, you can enter and run code right inside this page. Please make sure to only remove the underscores to add your answers. Since the tidyverse was loaded above, all the functions you would normally see in RStudio are available. Once you enter the code, click the blue Run Code button to see the results.\nThe first thing you need to learn is how many rows are in the starwars data, along with all the columns and datatypes.\nWhat function would you add to the starwars data here to glimpse the data and find those answers?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the glimpse() function. You can learn more here.\n\n\n\n\nJust as you submitted the answer, your humanoid robot editor (J-327D) pops into your office and asks you how many people (characters) are in your data. What is your answer?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the rows from the previous question.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Focusing on variables\nNow that we know how to glimpse into our data, let‚Äôs work on selecting specific variables of interest. Let‚Äôs say the Galactic News Hub has asked you to write a story about height differences across different species. What function would you use to select only the following variables in starwars: name, height, homeworld, and species? (Hint: Write your function in that order!)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nYou might look into the select() function, you can learn about here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Arranging our Data\nNow that we have glimpsed our data and selected our variables in the starwars, let‚Äôs arrange them using by height. What function would we add to our code below to arrange our data so that the tallest person is listed at the top? (Hint: since tidyverse arranges numbers from the smallest to the greatest number, you may need another function so the information is in descending order.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nI recommend checking out the arrange() function, you can learn about here. Don‚Äôt forget to put your result in descending order.\n\n\n\n\nSo many tall characters! If your humanoid robot editor (J-327D) wanted you to write a story about the tallest character in the data, who would that be?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHint 1\n\n\n\n\n\nLook at the result of previous code chunk\n\n\n\n\nGreat job! Please inform your JedR Master that you have completed this exercise. ‚ÄúYou have conquered much, but the next trial calls to you through the Force. Do you dare step forward?‚Äù Continue Your Journey"

    "text": "How to make categories from data\nWelcome Padawan. May your quest to become a JedR Master be fruitful. ‚ÄúDo or do not. There is no try.‚Äù\nSometimes as journalists (or data scientists) we need to create new categories for our data. An example might be where we have a column of data that has too many different values to plot effectively. We might be able to re-categorize those values to fewer individual choices, maybe combining less important values into a generic term like ‚Äúother‚Äù.\nSome real-worldish examples:\n\nYou want to show race/ethnicity breakdowns in a chart or story about Hispanic representation. There are eight different values and some are quite small. You might create a column to use the values Asian, Black, Hispanic and White with all others changed to ‚ÄúOther‚Äù.\nPerhaps you are doing a story on crime and want to highlight violent crimes vs property vs other crimes. You might create a new column that categorizes many individual charges into these buckets.\n\nWe‚Äôre taking records and putting them into piles or groups based on one or more values.\n\nJedR Mind Trick: When we categorize values like this, we want to create a new column intead of overwriting an existing one.

    "text": "Using case_match()\nOne of the easier methods to categorize data is to use case_match(). The logic is straighforward: For this value, substitute that value.\nTo make clear our goal here for the Galactic Hub News: We want to create a new column called species_category that has three values: Human, Droid, Other/Unknown. And they need to be based on the existing species variable.\n\nHow case_match works\nWhile is is possible to recatagorize our values into the same column, a good JedR will instead use mutate() and case_when() to create a new column and then fill it with the results.\ndata |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    new_column = case_when(\n      existing_column,\n      \"Old Value 1 from existing_column\" ~ \"New Value 1\",\n      \"Old Value 2 from existing_column\" ~ \"New Value 2\",\n      .default = \"Value for everything else\"\n    )\n  )\n\nThis is standard usage for the mutate() function ‚Ä¶ you create the new column and then set it to a value. In this case, we are setting the value to the result of the case_when() function.\nWithin case_when(), we have to first name the column we are pulling from. Like where are we looking for these values?\nThen we have a series of statements separated with ~. If we find what is on the left-hand side, then we change it to what is on the right-hand side.\nLastly we have a ‚Äúdefault‚Äù to handle everything else we haven‚Äôt specified. In some cases you might make this .default = existing_column to keep the existing value for those rows.\n\nThe order you put these is important. Once a match has been found and updated, that value won‚Äôt be changed again.\nSo, with our starwars data, a partial solution might look like this:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nstarwars |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    species_category = case_match(\n      species,\n      \"Gungan\" ~ \"Other/Unknown\",\n      \"Neimodian\" ~ \"Other/Unknown\"\n    )\n  ) |&gt; # using select and slice to focus on the change\n  select(name, species, species_category) |&gt; slice(31:40)\n\nIn the example above, we use slice() to skip down to part of the data where we can see the change. (The first 20 rows are all humans and droids.) We also used select() to focus on our columns of interest.\nNote we‚Äôve only changed two of the values we need to change, though. (You can see Toydarian and Dug have not been changed.) This method is very handy if you have just a few things to change.\nIn our case here, we could list all 36 changes, but ‚Ä¶ Use the Force, Luke.\n\n\nUsing .default\ncase_match() changes exactly what you specify and leaves anything you don‚Äôt specify as NA. If you want the non-matches to be something else, you can specify them with .default =.\nUsing this, we can set Human to Human and Droid to Droid, but then everything else to Other/Unknown.\nNOTE that the specific matches use ~ to separate what to look for and what to change it to, but the .default designation uses =.\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nstarwars |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    species_category = case_match(\n      species,\n      \"Human\" ~ \"Human\",\n      \"Droid\" ~ \"Droid\",\n      .default = \"Other/Unknown\",\n    )\n  ) |&gt; # using select and slice to focus on change\n  select(name, species, species_category) |&gt; slice(31:40)\n\n\n\nCheck your results\n\nJedR Mind Trick: Even with these few rows, it‚Äôs hard to see all the changes made in your data. It is sometimes helpful to do a count() on your changes to check them. Just be sure to count the already-changed data, not the result you are saving into the new object.\n\nHere we save the recategorized data into a new object called sw_species and then run a count() on our two columns to check the results.\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nsw_species &lt;- starwars |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    species_category = case_match(\n      species,\n      \"Human\" ~ \"Human\",\n      \"Droid\" ~ \"Droid\",\n      .default = \"Other/Unknown\",\n    )\n  )\n\nsw_species |&gt; \n  count(species, species_category, sort = TRUE)\n\nThe case_match() function works great if you have one-to-one changes that don‚Äôt require logic. But when you have more complex needs, we need more Force."

    "text": "Parsing dates: How to reconize dates in R\nNotice that when we used the glimpse() above, we also got info about the type of each column. The episode number and season are read as dbl (‚Äúdoubles, which is a number‚Äù), whereas the episode title and air date are read as chr (‚Äúcharacters‚Äù).\nTo work effectively with dates, we need R to recognize when we‚Äôre reading with dates. Do fix this, we can use lubridate‚Äôs parse date functions. In this particular dataset, the dates are written in the dmy (date-month-year) format. (If you look in the glimpse() output above, you‚Äôll see that the first observation, for example, was: ‚Äú13-Oct-14‚Äù). Let‚Äôs use lubridate‚Äôs dmy() function to create a new version of the dataset, called rebels_fix, which has a new column called air_date_fixed:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nrebels |&gt; \n  mutate(air_date_fixed = dmy(original_air_date)) |&gt; \n  glimpse()\n\nNotice that, in the chunk above, we‚Äôre just looking at the output to see that this worked as intented. See that the air_date_fixed column is being read as a date whereas the original_air_date column was read as a character? Also, we‚Äôre not saving it into a new object using the &lt;- operator. Let‚Äôs use the &lt;- operator operator to save our work in a new object, called rebels_cl, without the original_air_date column, which we‚Äôre not going to need:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nrebels_cl &lt;- rebels |&gt; \n  mutate(air_date_fixed = dmy(original_air_date)) |&gt; \n  select(-original_air_date)\n\nrebels_cl |&gt; glimpse()\n\nTwo key things to notice here:\n\nair_date_fixed has the format date.\nIn air_date_fixed, the year is written first, followed by the month and then the day. That‚Äôs just what the date format looks like in R.\n\nIn this example, lubridate‚Äôs dmy() function came in handy. Here are some other functions we might‚Äôve used if the dates had been formatted differently:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\n### when using the mdy function, R knows that the first value is month, followed by day, followed by year\nmdy(\"May 15, 1988\")\n\n### here, the ymd function makes it clear that the first value is year, followed by month, followed by day\nymd(\"1988-May-15\")\n\nYou can find more examples and tips in this cheatsheet.\n\nPadawan practice: Parsing dates\nHere‚Äôs a small portion of the data, called parsing_practice_df, with three columns that need to be parsed:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nparsing_practice_df\n\nEach column is currently written in the character format and should be converted to the date format. Can you figure out how to do this?\n\nPractice: Parse date1\nHint: Replace the three lines, ___ with the appropriate function.\n\n#| exercise: ex_1\nparsing_practice_df |&gt; \n  mutate(date1_cleaned = ___(date1))\n\n\n#| exercise: ex_1\n#| check: true\nif (identical(.result, parsing_practice_df |&gt; \n  mutate(date1_cleaned = ymd(date1)))) {\n  list(correct = TRUE, message = \"Correct, young Padawan! We're using the ymd() function to indicate that the year goes first, followed by month, followed by day. This is our way of telling R how to parse this date.\")\n} else {\n  list(correct = FALSE, message = sample(again_list, 1))\n}\n\nHere, as in the two following exercises, we‚Äôre not saving the output but only displaying it. If we wanted to save it, we‚Äôd use the &lt;- operator. Okay, see if you can solve the two following exercises, too!\n\n\nPractice: Parse date2\n\n#| exercise: ex_2\nparsing_practice_df |&gt; \n  mutate(date2_cleaned = ___(date2))\n\n\n#| exercise: ex_2\n#| check: true\nif (identical(.result, parsing_practice_df |&gt; \n  mutate(date2_cleaned = mdy(date2)))) {\n  list(correct = TRUE, message = \"Bravo, Padawan!

    "text": "Using specific parts of a date\n\nWhich month had the most episodes (throughout the entire period)?\nTo answer this question, we can use Lubridate‚Äôs month() function, which allows us to focus only on months (while ignoring years). It works like this:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nrebels_cl_newcols &lt;- rebels_cl |&gt; \n  mutate(month = month(air_date_fixed))\n\nrebels_cl_newcols |&gt; glimpse()\n\nHere, we‚Äôre creating a new dataframe called rebels_cl_newcols. We‚Äôll use this to add more columns later on.\nIt‚Äôs worth keeping in mind that ‚Äúmonth‚Äù is now the name of a column (which we just created) and the name of a function from the lubridate package. That can be a bit confusing and it‚Äôs generally best to avoid creating object with the same names as functions.\nAlso, see how the newly created month column only has information about which month the episodes aired in, in this case ‚Äú10‚Äù (October) for the first three observations and ‚Äú11‚Äù (November) for the next four observations. If we wanted the names of the months, we can use the label = TRUE argument within the month function. Like this:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nrebels_cl_newcols &lt;- rebels_cl_newcols |&gt; \n  mutate(month = month(air_date_fixed, label = TRUE))\n\nrebels_cl_newcols |&gt; glimpse()\n\nNotice that the type for month is ‚Äúord‚Äù? This means that the column is written as an ‚Äúordered factor‚Äù, which simply means (in this case) that although it looks like text, it would be ordered by time, not alphabetically. In other words, we can sort by the month column, if we want to do so:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nrebels_cl_newcols |&gt; \n  select(episode_title, month) |&gt; \n  arrange(month)\n\nSee how it‚Äôs arranged by month?\nGoing back to our question about which month had the most episodes, let‚Äôs take a look:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nrebels_cl_newcols |&gt; \n  count(month, name = \"number_of_episodes\") |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(number_of_episodes) )\n\nIt looks like there were lot‚Äôs of new episodes in October, November, February, and March.\nAs a quick aside, when we do the month labels, we can also get R to write out the full month rather than the abbreviation. Let‚Äôs look at an example:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nmonth(\"2022-05-04\", label = TRUE, abbr = FALSE)\n\nThe abbr argument defaults to TRUE, so if we don‚Äôt specific abbr = FALSE, we‚Äôd get the abbreviated version as we saw above.\n\nPadawan practice: using the year() function\nTo get information about specific years, we can use the year() function, which is quite similar. Try to create a variable called year see we can check how many episodes aired in each year.\nHint: you‚Äôll need to use the air_date_fixed column.\n\n#| exercise: ex_5\n### USE THE year() FUNCTION HERE TO CREATE A NEW VARIABLE CALLED \"year\"\nrebels_cl_newcols |&gt; \n  mutate(______)|&gt; \n  group_by(year) |&gt; \n  count(name = \"number_of_episodes\") |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(number_of_episodes))\n\n\n#| exercise: ex_5\n#| check: true\nif (identical(.result, rebels_cl_newcols |&gt; \n  mutate(year = year(air_date_fixed)) |&gt; \n  group_by(year) |&gt; \n  count(name = \"number_of_episodes\") |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(number_of_episodes)))) {\n  list(correct = TRUE, message = sample(praise_list,1))\n} else {\n  list(correct = FALSE, message = sample(again_list, 1))\n}\n\n\n\n\nFloor_date()\nAn alternative would be to use Lubridate‚Äôs floor_date()-function, which let‚Äôs us round date-time objects down to their nearest year, month, week, day, etc. It works like this:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nrebels_cl_newcols |&gt; \n  mutate( #use the mutate function to create a new column\n    month_floor = #set the new column name to \n      floor_date(air_date_fixed, #use the round_date function on our existing date varible\n                       \"month\")) |&gt; #we want to round to nearest month\n  select(episode_title, month_floor) |&gt; #we only want to view these columns now\n  head(10) #print just the ten first rows\n\nNotice that the new column, month_floor, only include dates that are the first day in any given month?\nRounding the dates to their nearest year/month/week/day/etc can be helpful later on, for example when visualizing the data. Instead of round to the nearest values, we can use ceiling_date() to round up to the nearest value or round_date() to round to the closest value. In this tutorial we‚Äôll mostly focus on floor_date() but as a future JedR Master, you should know about the other options, too!\nOkay, let‚Äôs create a dataframe with four new columns, rounded by floor_date(). We‚Äôll use this later on.\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nrebels_rounded_cols &lt;- rebels_cl_newcols |&gt; \n  mutate(year_fl = floor_date(air_date_fixed, \"year\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(month_fl = floor_date(air_date_fixed, \"month\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(week_fl = floor_date(air_date_fixed, \"week\")) |&gt;\n  mutate(day_fl = floor_date(air_date_fixed, \"day\"))\n\nrebels_rounded_cols |&gt; select(episode_title, year_fl, month_fl, week_fl, day_fl) |&gt; glimpse()\n\n\n\nThe yday() function\nWhat if we wanted to find the earliest date within a year that an episode aired? For that purpose, we could use the yday() (year day) function, which simply tells us how many days into a year a given date is. My son and I share the same birthday (February 5). That‚Äôs the 36th day of the year:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nyday(\"2022-02-05\")\n\nTo find the earliest episode airdate for each year, we could do this:\n\n#| edit: FALSE\nrebels_rounded_cols |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    dy = yday(air_date_fixed),\n    year = year(air_date_fixed)) |&gt; \n  group_by(year) |&gt; \n  slice_min(air_date_fixed) |&gt; \n  ungroup() |&gt;\n  select(episode_title, season, air_date_fixed, year, dy)\n\nThis shows the first-aired episode for each of the years from 2014‚Äì2018. Notice the few doppelg√§ngers? It looks like seasons 3 and 4 started each started with a double episode.\nThere are few things going on in the chunk above. Here‚Äôs a quick recap of what each line does:\n\nWe start with our object, rebels_rounded_cols, and then ‚Ä¶\nWe use mutate() to create a new column called dy ‚Ä¶\nTo get the dy column to specify each dates number within a year, we use yday(), and then ‚Ä¶\nWe group_by() because we want the earliest episode within each year, and then ‚Ä¶\nWe use slice_min() to get just the earliest episode within each year. (Otherwise, our output would all the episodes.) And then ‚Ä¶\nWe use ungroup() to remove the grouped dy column. Not essential here but might be handy if you need to perform additional operations. And then ‚Ä¶\nselect() let‚Äôs us show just a few columns to make the output more readable at a glance."

Remember above where we used floor_date() to round all dates down to their nearest month?

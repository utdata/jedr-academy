# Contributing to JedR Training

I actually haven't thought through this yet, but here are some things that come to mind.

- **Follow our styles**. Look at the existing tutorials and trials. Follow the fun you find there.
- **Naming conventions**. Put tutorials in the `tutorials/` folders and trials in the `trails/` folder. Start their names with `jedr-` so that will be easily reflected when we publish to shinyapps.io.

# Welcome to JedR Academy

## What is JedR Academy?

To be clear, this isn’t a package.

This project is a series of [quarto live](https://r-wasm.github.io/quarto-live/)
interactive tutorials designed to develop and improve R skills with a
heavy lean on the [tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org/). There are
two main goals:

- To focus tutorials on feats of skill or tasks to accomplish instead of
  on specific packages or functions.
- To use the same data whenever possible to avoid the cognitive load of
  learning new data for each example.

There are two types of lessons:

- [**JedR Trials**](/resources/trials.html): Short tests over specific skills. These trials are used by students in our J 327D Reporting with Data class.
- [**JedR Training**](/resources/training.html): Tutorials focused on feats of skills instead of on
  specific packages. For instance, “How to manage dates” vs “How to use
  lubridate.”

JedR Padawans can complete these lessons online through the provided links, 
without additional setup. For those who prefer working locally, you can 
[download the repo](https://github.com/utdata/jedr-academy) to run each notebook 
directly on your machine. The notebooks are organized in the `/trials` and 
`/training` folders.

## Data sources

Our lessons are built around the Star Wars universe, primarily utilizing the 
[starwars](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/starwars.html) "characters" 
data from the tidyverse package. To enhance these lessons, we've incorporated 
additional Star Wars data, which can be found in the `/data` folder.
The starwars data from tidyverse offers a well-sized dataset that's both 
approachable and intricate, making it a valuable learning tool. If you'd like to

## Credits

This project was the brainchild of [Christian
McDonald](https://journalism.utexas.edu/faculty/christian-mcdonald),
associate professor of practice at the School of Journalism and Media at
the University of Texas at Austin. He began collaborating soon
thereafter with [Dr. Jo
Lukito](https://journalism.utexas.edu/faculty/jo-lukito), an assistant
professor also at UT JaM.

Other contributors include:

- [Christian
  Overgaard](https://journalism.utexas.edu/graduate/profiles/doctoral/christian-staal-bruun-overgaard),
  Doctoral student. He helped think through the project and wrote the "Managing dates" tutorial.
- Tamara Rodriguez designed our JedR hex logo.
- Johan Villatoro transitioned lessons and training into WebR.

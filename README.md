JedR Master Tutorials
================

A series of R tutorials and trails based on a common set of Star Wars datasets.

The project is in its infancy. You know, like Baby Yoda.

## Tutorials

- [Categorization](): When you need to
    re-categorize your data.

## Trails

- [01 Tidyverse](https://utdata.shinyapps.io/01_tidyverse/)
- [02 Summarize with count](https://utdata.shinyapps.io/02_summarize_count/)
- [03 Summarize with math](https://utdata.shinyapps.io/03_summarize_math/)
- [04 Intro to ggplot](https://utdata.shinyapps.io/04_intro_ggplot/)

## Data sources

- [starwars](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/starwars.html) characters dataset from the tidyverse. Itâ€™s our main data set. Small enough to wrap your head around; complex and dirty enough to provide a perfect example.
- [starwarsrebels]() A list of episodes from the *Star Wars Rebels* animated series, scrapped from [tvmaze](https://www.tvmaze.com/shows/117/star-wars-rebels/episodes). The dates have been purposefully mucked for the trail it is used in.

### From Kaggle

All this data will need checking and cleaning.

-   `characters`
-   `planets`
-   `species`
-   `starships`
-   `vehicles`

With exception of characters, the above is from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars), which was gathered
using the Star Wars API that is no longer available. The origin of the
data is The Star Wars Wiki: <https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki>.

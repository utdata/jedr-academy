A series of R tutorials based on a common set of Star Wars datasets.

The project is in its infancy. You know, like Baby Yoda.

## Tutorials

    re-categorize your data.

## Data sources

-   [starwars](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/starwars.html)
    characters dataset from the tidyverse. Itâ€™s our main data set. Small
    enough to wrap your head around; complex and dirty enough to provide
    a perfect example.

### From Kaggle

All this data will need checking and cleaning.

-   `characters`
-   `planets`
-   `species`
-   `starships`
-   `vehicles`

With exception of characters, the above is from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/jsphyg/star-wars), which was gathered
using the Star Wars API that is no longer available. The origin of the
data is The Star Wars Wiki: <https://starwars.fandom.com/wiki>.
